    <h3>Holly Riordan</h3>
  </section>

  <section class="article">
  <div>Being strong and independent doesn’t mean you push away others. It doesn’t mean you refuse to let anyone close to you because you can handle your problems on your own. It doesn’t mean you shut out the rest of the world and isolate yourself because you’re better off without anyone else.</div>

  <div>Part of being strong and independent is knowing when you are in trouble. You should be wise enough to recognize when you’re struggling, to ask for help when you need it, to reach out for a helping hand. It’s not weak to admit you’re having a rough time. It’s not weak to text someone when you’re unsure how to overcome a certain obstacle. It’s not weak to be vulnerable.</div>

  <div >You don’t want to confuse stubbornness with independence. Independence means you can handle yourself most of the time. It means you can come up with solutions to your problems most of the time. It means you can survive on your own most of the time. However, there are always going to be exceptions. Even the most independent person is going to need to ask for helps at some point. No one is superhuman.</div>

  <div>Don’t let your ego get in the way of your happiness. Don’t consider yourself a failure if you end up needing assistance. There’s nothing wrong with relying on others. There’s nothing wrong with asking them for favors and returning them later.</div>
  </section>

<section class="vertical-quote">
  <div>
     <h4>
      Remember, being strong and independent doesn’t mean you need to spend every waking minute alone. It doesn’t mean you have to cut everyone out of your world. It doesn’t mean you need to keep your problems to yourself and handle them in secret, without letting anyone in on the fact you’re struggling.
    </h4>
  </div>
</section>


<section class="pull-quote">
  <div>
    <h2>
      You’re allowed to discuss your problems with your loved ones. You’re allowed to ask for their advice. You’re allowed to request help. You’re allowed to be imperfect.
    </h2>
  </div>

  <section class="articles">
    <div>Sometimes, the strongest thing you can do is admit you need help. You should be proud of yourself for being honest with yourself. You should be glad you’re comfortable enough with yourself to act authentically.</div>

    <div>Remember, being strong and independent doesn’t mean you need to stay single. It doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy it when your partner takes control, picks the date, drives the car, makes the plans. You’re allowed to sit back and relax every once in a while. You’re allowed to let others do something nice for you.</div>

    <div>Just because you can do something on your own doesn’t mean you have to. You can let others pamper you. You can let them take care of you. You can let them spoil you. You don’t have to push them away. Maybe you don’t need them — but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t keep them around. It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t love them.</div>

    <div>You aren’t going to lose your independence when you allow others into your universe. You can date someone and still be independent. You can accept help and still be independent. You can be in touch with your vulnerable side and still be independent.</div>
